# 8 summary

1. Get best of tools you already use (npm, git, linters)
2. Check early for errors
3. Automate what you can (lint --fix, git hooks, prettier, PR verification, CI/CD)
4. Don't be afraid to learn new things and tools
5. Don't leave everyting to DevOps - learn some 'magic' yourself (frontend ops?)
